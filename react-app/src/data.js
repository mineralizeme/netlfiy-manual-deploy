      "Unrefined Baja Gold Kosher Sea Salt contains all minerals and trace elements known to exist in seawater, small amounts of magnesium and calcium halides and sulfates, salt-resistant beneficial micro-organisms and sediment particles. Calcium and magnesium salt compounds convey a faintly sharper overtone and cause unrefined sea salt to become hygroscopic (i.e. it gradually absorbs moisture from the air if stored uncovered). Algal products contribute a mild “sea-air” scent.  Sediments provide additional minerals and trace element compounds and give Baja Gold an off-white or slightly beige appearance. The taste and aroma of these compounds, even in minute concentrations, are often detectable by humans.",

      "SEA-CROP is a soil stimulant and mineral feed supplement for animals. SEA-CROP has a wide variety of benefits and a composition that makes it unique. The benefits that most often attract large farmers and production growers are the yield improvement, stress tolerance and soil building capabilities.  CSA farmers, gardeners and homesteaders are drawn to the nutritional improvements, fantastic taste and better keeping qualities of the food.  Ornamental growers and gardeners enjoy the lush vegetation and bountiful flowers whereas nursery owners find the disease resistance and stress tolerance helpful in delivering quality products. However, it is the composition of the Pacific Ocean derived trace minerals and carbon compounds create an exceptional synergy worth exploring.",

The particular sea utilized by SeaAgri is considered as one of the most diverse in marine life and minerals on earth. The full spectrum minerals and trace elements contained in SEA-90 are exactly proportioned and balanced as in sea water to sustain optimum biological life. Consider that the elements in sea water are at essentially the same ratios as human blood, and that sea life living in pure and balanced ocean water seems immune to most cancer and other degenerative diseases.",

    company: "GroPal",
    info:
      "GroPAL™ is a highly concentrated ocean water concentrate that goes through a number of natural solar concentration processes. It is during these processes that the sodium levels gradually reduce leaving an ionic solution that is both low in sodium and yet packed full of other minerals and trace elements. \n It is these bio-essential building blocks of life that are missing in many types of soil because they were either never there or lost long ago. GroPAL™ remedies this situation by infusing these essential nutrients back into the soil, the plant & the ecosystem. That’s the difference between a fair and a very good season. Minerals and equally important trace elements have an absolutely stunning effect on soil and plant health. They are required as an enzymatic activator, growth stimulator and a catalyst in the formation of all other nutrients in plants. Naturally balanced by nature GroPAL™ is safe, nutrient dense, OMRI Listed and a viable alternative to chemicals that don’t contribute to loss of soil nutrients. Additionally, GroPAL™ helps maintain and enhances soil quality over time under sensible and sustainable soil management programs.",

      "It’s easy for you to grow robust, healthy, nutritious foods and gorgeous flowers – just put the necessary minerals back into the soil! Our Effortless Garden® Ionic Ocean Minerals is an advanced mineral product that utilizes essential elements from the ocean to give your plants exactly what they need for optimal growth. Many crop problems start with demineralized soil – leading to foods that are not vibrantly colored as they should be, tasteless, and lacking nutrition. The ocean provides all the minerals needed for plant growth, but the salt kills the soil and plants. Other mineral products dilute the ocean water, keeping the salt. Effortless Garden® Ionic Ocean Minerals uses a high-tech process to remove the salt and concentrate the minerals, for unmatched, outstanding quality.",

    company: "Acres USA Publishing",
    info:
      "Maynard Murray was a medical doctor who researched the crucial importance of minerals - especially trace elements - to plants and animals. Beginning in 1938 and continuing through the 1950s, Dr. Murray used sea solids - mineral salts remaining after water is evaporated from ocean water - as fertilizer on a variety of vegetables, fruits and grains. His extensive experiments demonstrated repeatedly and conclusively that plants fertilized with sea solids and animals fed sea-solid-fertilized feeds grow stronger and more resistant to disease. Sea Energy Agriculture recounts Murray's experiments and presents his astounding conclusions. The work of this eco-pioneer was largely ignored during his lifetime, and his book became a lost classic - out-of-print for more than 25 years. Now this rare volume is once again available, with a new foreward and afterword by the founder of Acres U.S.A., Charles Walters.",
